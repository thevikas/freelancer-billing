## Background


[Gtimelog](https://github.com/gtimelog/gtimelog) has been my oldest and most simple time tracking app.Originally this project started with just a command line tool for using gtimelog.

Later had setup a git based timelog.txt sync system for the many dev stations I use. This helps keep my timelog.txt same in all machines. Like a desktop in one place and my mac on another.

Later using other PCs where all setup was not done or if it was Windows. I still need to do time tracking. So this is now this is gradually also progressing towards web based time tracking. This is just for cases when command line linux-like env is not setup to run php/gtimelog/git/ssh.

Already a setup of git for storing timelog.txt helps in web migration cause it always has latest copy of the timelog.

The timelog itself is a private repo. :)

EXAMPLES
------------

To add a new entry:
`gt "project2: doing something"`

To repeat the last entry
`gt last`

To add a away ** between work and then repeat the last entry
`gt away`

It does not do anything else like make reports,etc (though I could). For that you can use the GUI gtimelog itself.
